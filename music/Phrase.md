- Music works via expectations we develop when we compare motives and phrases. 
- Structure
	- The beginning must attract attention.
	- Then the phrase evolves, either by carrying the opening [[motive]] to a local peak, or else by proposing a prominent motivic contrast.
	- The phrase closes with some kind of punctuation.
Development
	- Development ideas:
	Rising peaks in the melody.
	- Accelerating harmonic rhythm.
	- Fragmentation of the motive into smaller chunks.
- Increasingly dissonant harmony.
The point of development is not to maintain the same level of intensity through the phrase.
