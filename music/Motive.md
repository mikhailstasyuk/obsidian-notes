- Motives shape and enhance the musical essence.
- Contrasts within a motive can occur in pitch sequence, rhythm, or both (seldom in timbre, dynamics, articulation, etc.).
- Motivic similarity ranges from 1 to 5, with 1 representing near repetition and 5 indicating significant alteration (lower values for maintaining continuity, higher for introducing contrast, such as in new sections).
- Reserve the most striking contrasts for pivotal moments, as excessive use diminishes their impact.
- Avoid saturating the composition with the motive; allow space for musical breath. Introduce neutral passages or employ clich√©s when necessary.
- Implement motive embellishments following the initial presentation of a motive or phrase.

A poorly crafted musical motive lacks coherence and fails to create a memorable pattern. Characteristics include:

1. Lack of clear repetition or development: The motive may be weakly developed, making it difficult for listeners to discern a recognizable pattern.
2. Disjointedness: Transitions between variations of the motive may feel abrupt or disconnected, preventing a cohesive flow of the music.
3. Inconsistent rhythmic patterns: Changes in rhythmic structure can disrupt the continuity of the motive, causing listeners to focus more on the differences rather than the similarities.
4. Irrelevant elements: Addition of unrelated musical elements can distract from the main motive, diminishing its impact.
5. Lack of association: Variations of the motive may not maintain a strong association with the original idea, leading to a lack of focus and coherence in the music.
6. Absence of recognizable features: Variations of the motive may deviate significantly in rhythm or melody, making it difficult for listeners to recognize or recall the motive.

Overall, a poorly crafted musical motive fails to create a cohesive and memorable musical idea, resulting in a lack of focus and direction in the music.
